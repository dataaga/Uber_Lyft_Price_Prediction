# Uber_Lyft_Price_Prediction

Introduction <br>
This project aims to predict the prices of Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, MA, using machine learning techniques. The increasing popularity of ride-hailing services has led to a demand for accurate fare prediction models, which can be beneficial to both service providers and passengers. By building a reliable price prediction model, I can help users make informed decisions about their transportation choices and assist ride-hailing companies in optimizing their pricing strategies. <br>

Data Source <br>
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found here. It contains historical data from Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, MA, including various attributes such as pickup and dropoff locations, timestamps, and ride prices. I will use this data to train and evaluate our prediction models. <br>

Dataset Description <br>
The dataset comprises the following columns: <br>

datetime: Timestamp of the ride. <br>
cab_type: The type of ride service (Uber/Lyft). <br>
name: The car type or service category (e.g., UberPool, UberX, Lyft XL). <br>
distance: The distance of the ride in miles. <br>
destination: The dropoff location. <br>
source: The pickup location. <br>
price: The price of the ride, which will be our target variable for prediction. <br>

Data Exploration <br>
Before building my prediction model, I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. This will involve visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution of variables, identify any patterns, and handle missing or erroneous data if necessary. <br>

Feature Engineering <br>
Feature engineering is a crucial step in building a successful prediction model. I will create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the dataset. Techniques like one-hot encoding, normalization, and handling categorical variables will be applied to prepare the data for model training. <br>

Model Building <br>
In this section, I will build and train the prediction models using various machine learning algorithms. I will split the dataset into training and testing sets, fit the models to the training data, and tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. <br>

Model Evaluation <br>
To evaluate the performance of our models, I will use appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. By comparing the results of different models, I can select the best-performing one for our final predictions. <br>
